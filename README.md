Abstract:
         The students studying Electrical Engineering in universities have to solve circuit analysis problems which involves time consuming calculations.
Our main idea was to design a calculator that can serve the purpose of normal scientific calculator and lca calculator which can check if circuit calculations
are right or not. For this purpose we have created functions for performing circuit analysis calculations. Our 'EE calculator' can perform operations such as 
calculating resistances in series and parallel, converting delta to wye and vice versa and voltage division calculations. Also it is able to show basic electrical
circuits to visualize the basic concepts.
